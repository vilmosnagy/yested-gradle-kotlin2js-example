# Yested example project (with Gradle)

A small example Yested project (with the contents of the [Getting Started](http://www.yested.net/sample-page) documentation) compiled with Kotlin2JS and Gradle.

Also, a minimal example on how to compile Kotlin to JavaScript with Gradle.

You could build this project with the `./gradlew build` command. The compiled `*.js` files will be under the `dist/js/` directory.
